## Introduction
Welcome to the Gravity Books Sales End-to-End Project repository. This project is an exemplary demonstration of a complete data warehousing solution, encompassing the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) phase, analysis phase with SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), and reporting phase using Pivot Table and Power BI.

## Project Phases
1. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: In this phase, data is extracted from a transactional database called "Gravity Book Sales," transformed to meet data warehousing requirements, and loaded into a structured data warehouse.
2. **Analysis**: The data is modeled and structured for efficient querying and analysis using SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).
3. **Reporting**: Interactive reports and visualizations are created using Pivot Table in Excel and Power BI, allowing end-users to derive insights from the data.

## Data Source
The source dataset for this project is the "Gravity Book Sales" database, which can be found [here](https://github.com/bbrumm/databasestar/tree/main/sample_databases/sample_db_gravity/gravity_sqlserver). This transactional database serves as the foundation for the end-to-end project.

## Technologies Used
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)
- Pivot Table (Excel)
- Power BI
