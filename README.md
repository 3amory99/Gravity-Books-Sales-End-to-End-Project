## Introduction
Welcome to the Gravity Books Sales End-to-End Project repository. This project is an exemplary demonstration of a complete data warehousing solution, encompassing the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) phase, analysis phase with SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), and reporting phase using Pivot Table and Power BI.

## Project Phases
1. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: In this phase, data is extracted from a transactional database called "Gravity Book Sales," transformed to meet data warehousing requirements, and loaded into a structured data warehouse.
2. **Analysis**: The data is modeled and structured for efficient querying and analysis using SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).
3. **Reporting**: Interactive reports and visualizations are created using Pivot Table in Excel and Power BI, allowing end-users to derive insights from the data.

## Data Source
The source dataset for this project is the "Gravity Book Sales" database, which can be found [here](https://github.com/bbrumm/databasestar/tree/main/sample_databases/sample_db_gravity/gravity_sqlserver). This transactional database serves as the foundation for the end-to-end project.

## Technologies Used
- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)
- Pivot Table (Excel)
- Power BI

## Getting Started
To explore and replicate the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. [Download and install SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) if not already installed.
3. Follow the instructions in the respective folders for each project phase (ETL, Analysis, Reporting) to set up and execute the code.

## Analysis Phase
To explore the analysis phase, refer to the [Analysis folder](/Analysis).

This project harnesses the power of SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) for advanced data modeling and analysis. In particular, we've employed the Tabular mode of OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) to create efficient data models that cater to our analytical needs.

- **Tabular Mode:** We've chosen to work with the Tabular mode in SSAS. This mode specializes in constructing tabular data models, which provide a streamlined, relational view of the data. It excels in scenarios where data retrieval speed and simplicity are top priorities.

## Reporting Phase
For reporting and visualization using Pivot Table and Power BI, visit the [Reporting folder](/Reporting).

The reporting phase in this project is designed to provide users with the flexibility and tools to gain insights from the data. We've incorporated two distinct types of reporting to cater to different user needs:

#### 1. Pivot Table Reporting

Pivot tables are a well-known and versatile tool within Microsoft Excel, allowing users to analyze, aggregate, and visualize data in a tabular format. This method of reporting is particularly useful when you need to perform basic ad-hoc analysis or create custom reports directly in Excel. With pivot tables, users can slice and dice the data to answer specific questions and gain insights quickly.

* Total Quantity, Total Price, Total Shipping Cost, Total Revenue of the 12 months over all years

* The Best-selling language books

* Total Quantity, Total Price, Total Shipping Cost, Total Revenue of all shipping methods for countries.

* Total Price of all Years

#### 2. Power BI Dashboard Reporting

Power BI is a powerful business intelligence tool that delivers interactive and dynamic reports, dashboards, and data visualizations. It is designed for self-service reporting, enabling users to explore data intuitively, create compelling visualizations, and share insights with others. Power BI reports are ideal for more in-depth analysis, interactive dashboards, and data-driven storytelling.

These two types of reporting options provide a spectrum of reporting capabilities to suit various user preferences and needs. Whether you prefer the simplicity and familiarity of pivot tables or the dynamic and interactive experience of Power BI, this project offers a range of reporting tools to empower you to extract valuable insights from the data.
